# Publishing to GitHub - Instructions

## Current Status
✅ All files are committed locally  
✅ Git remote is configured  
⚠️ Authentication needs to be completed

## Option 1: Using Personal Access Token (Recommended)

### Step 1: Verify Your Token
Your GitHub Personal Access Token should have these permissions:
- `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
- `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
cd /Users/pjones/azure-modernization-app

# Use your token as the password when prompted
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials:
- **Username**: `pjones-git`
- **Password**: Your Personal Access Token (the one you provided)

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (If You Have It)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (if not already installed)
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Using SSH Keys

### Step 1: Check if you have SSH keys
```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh
```

### Step 2: If no SSH key exists, create one
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "patrick.jones@lextechnical.com"
```

### Step 3: Add SSH key to ssh-agent
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### Step 4: Copy public key
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### Step 5: Add to GitHub
1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
2. Click "New SSH key"
3. Paste your public key
4. Save

### Step 6: Change remote to SSH and push
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:pjones-git/AzureLiftShiftModerinization.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution**: Your token might be expired. Generate a new one:
1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo`, `workflow`
4. Copy the token
5. Use it as password when pushing

### Issue: "remote: Invalid username or token"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure you're using your GitHub username: `pjones-git`
- Ensure the token has correct permissions
- Try regenerating the token
